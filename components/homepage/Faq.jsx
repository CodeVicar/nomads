    question: "Can I get invoice factoring if my business has bad credit?",

    question:
      "What happens if a client doesnâ€™t pay the invoice to the factoring company?",
    answer:
      "If a client fails to pay the invoice, the factoring company may either pursue the payment directly from the client or charge back the amount to the business depending on the terms of the factoring agreement, which may be recourse or non-recourse.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between recourse and non-recourse invoice factoring?",
    answer:
      "In recourse factoring, the business retains the risk of non-payment, and if the client fails to pay, the business must repurchase the invoice from the factoring company. In non-recourse factoring, the factoring company assumes the risk of non-payment, and if the client fails to pay due to insolvency or other reasons covered by the agreement, the factoring company absorbs the loss.",
